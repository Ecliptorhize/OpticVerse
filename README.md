# Optiicverse

Optiicverse is a next-generation simulation and visualization framework developed by the Neuronbiotic Research Division. It is designed to model, analyze, and predict complex real-world systems — from biological networks to robotic swarms — within a unified virtual environment.

## Mission Statement

Optiicverse acts as a neural-linked digital universe where AI models, sensors, and physics systems converge to recreate intelligent behaviors, environments, and decision pathways. It bridges research data and immersive simulation, enabling researchers to safely test theories and workflows before committing to real-world deployment.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/` — Authoritative vision, focus areas, and ecosystem alignment documentation for the Optiicverse program.

## Getting Started

Documentation for Optiicverse is organized under the `docs/` directory. Begin with the [project overview](docs/overview.md) to understand the scope of the framework, then review the remaining documents for deeper dives into core vision, key focus areas, and the role Optiicverse plays within the Neuronbiotic ecosystem.

## Contributing

Contributions should maintain alignment with the strategic vision of Optiicverse. When proposing changes, update the documentation to ensure the evolving mission, focus areas, and integration points remain accurate.
